   SparkFun SIKIO - Circuit 6
   Hardware Concept: Analog In

   PURPOSE:
   This example shows how to make a simple circuit with a photocell to collect light intensity 
   data and display this information on screen. You also how to use a button log this data 
   to a text file on your Android's removable storage. 
   
   HARDWARE:
   -photocell
   -10k
   
   OPERATION:
   The sketch opens and reads an analog value off of the photocell. A line is printed, where the 
   height of the line depends on how much light is hitting the photocell. There is also a on-screen
   button that can be hit to log the analog data to a txt file onto your Android's removable storage.
   To access the data you logged, plug your Android back into the computer, turn on USB Storage, 
   and you should see a text file called 'sensorValues.txt' in the Sikio folder of your main directory.
   
   Make sure you check the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in addition to the normal 
   INTERNET permssion under 'sketch permissions'. It should be checked by default.
